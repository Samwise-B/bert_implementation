# Vanilla PyTorch Implementation of BERT

This project is a from-scratch implementation of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model using vanilla PyTorch. It is designed to demonstrate a deep understanding of the transformer architecture and its components. The implementation serves as an educational exercise in replicating one of the foundational models in NLP.

## Key Features

### Transformer Architecture
- **Encoder-Only Model**: Implemented the core BERT encoder architecture with multi-head self-attention and feedforward layers.
- **Layer Stacking**: Built the model with multiple encoder layers, each consisting of self-attention, normalization, and feedforward sublayers.
- **Positional Encoding**: Added positional embeddings to account for the order of input tokens, a crucial aspect of transformer models.

### Tokenization and Input Processing
- **Tokenizer Integration**: Processed input text by tokenizing and converting it into embeddings.
- **Segment and Mask Tokens**: Included segment embeddings and attention masks to handle sentence-pair tasks and ensure proper attention computation.

### Custom Implementation Details
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Implemented scaled dot-product attention with multiple attention heads, a core mechanism of transformers.
- **Feedforward Network**: Integrated position-wise feedforward networks within each encoder layer.
- **Layer Normalization and Dropout**: Applied layer normalization and dropout to stabilize training and prevent overfitting.
- **Pre-Training Objective**: Included masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) objectives for pre-training.
